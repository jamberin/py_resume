# Resume Site - Flask Application
v0.6.6
Flask application for my personal resume site.  This uses packages that 
I have used for a number of different applications and has private
information. If you have questions regarding data control, please 
contact me separately. I will outline proper installation techniques, as
well as proper usage below. The names will be pretty straight forward.
